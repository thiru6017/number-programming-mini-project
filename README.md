# Number Programming Mini Project

This is a Java-based menu-driven Number Programming mini project developed to practice core Java concepts and logical problem solving.

## Project Description
The application provides a console-based menu that allows users to select different number-related operations. Based on the selected option, the corresponding logic is executed and the result is displayed.

The project follows a layered architecture to maintain proper separation between user interaction and business logic.

## Features
- Menu-driven console application
- Implements the following number programs:
  - Factorial calculation
  - Prime number checking
  - Digits operations
  - Exponential calculations
  - Factors calculation
  - Advanced number operations
- Clear separation of User Layer and Business Layer
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- Git & GitHub
